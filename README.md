Concerts Code Challenge README
Welcome to the Week 3 Code Challenge on Concerts! In this assignment, you'll be working with a Concert domain model consisting of Bands, Venues, and Concerts. This README will guide you through the tasks and deliverables required for this challenge.

Overview
In this challenge, you'll create a database schema and implement various methods to manage and query concerts, bands, and venues using SQLAlchemy. You will work with the following models:

Band: Represents a music band.

Attributes: name (String), hometown (String)
Venue: Represents a concert venue.

Attributes: title (String), city (String)
Concert: Represents a concert event.

Attributes: date (String)
Relationships: Each concert belongs to a Band and a Venue.
Schema and Relationships
Tables
Bands Table

name: String
hometown: String
Venues Table

title: String
city: String
Concerts Table

date: String
Foreign Keys: band_id (references Band), venue_id (references Venue)
Relationships
A Band has many Concerts.
A Venue has many Concerts.
A Concert belongs to a Band and a Venue.
Deliverables
Migrations
Create Migrations for Concerts Table

Ensure that the concerts table includes foreign keys to bands and venues tables.
Add a date column of type String.
Test Migrations

Create instances of your classes to ensure the schema works correctly.
Object Relationship Methods
Implement the following methods using SQLAlchemy's querying capabilities:

Concert
band(): Returns the Band instance for this Concert.
venue(): Returns the Venue instance for this Concert.
Venue
concerts(): Returns a collection of all concerts at this Venue.
bands(): Returns a collection of all Bands that performed at this Venue.
Band
concerts(): Returns a collection of all concerts for this Band.
venues(): Returns a collection of all Venues where this Band performed.
Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Concert
hometown_show(): Returns True if the concert is in the band's hometown, otherwise False.
introduction(): Returns a string in the format:
arduino
Copy code
"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from {insert band hometown}"
Band
play_in_venue(venue, date): Takes a Venue instance and a date string to create a new concert for the band.
all_introductions(): Returns an array of strings with all the introductions for this band.
most_performances(): Class method that returns the Band instance with the most concerts.
Venue
concert_on(date): Takes a date string and returns the first concert at that venue on that date.
most_frequent_band(): Returns the band with the most concerts at this venue.
Setup

Notes
Make sure to draw your domain model before starting the implementation.
Ensure that all methods work correctly and return the expected results by testing them with sample data.
Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data and follow best practices for SQLAlchemy relationships.
